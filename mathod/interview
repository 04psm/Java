Is Java pass by value or pass by reference ? 

Pass by Value : The method parameter values are copied to another variable and then the copied object is passed 
				that's why it's called passed by value.

Pass by Reference : An alias or reference to the actual parameter is passed to the method, that's why it's 
					called pass by reference .
					
					
					The ans : Java is pass by value always !!!
